# place-your-pick-game
A game where given a random thing by a set of things, user have to pick and place in one of the pre-seted itens

## About
The ideia is to allow an user to create a set of anything he wants, like "carachters of a movie", for instance, and then create a list of itens that may be something like "features". With this created, a link is generated to play the game where users can choose at which feature to place the random carachter.

## Example
### Creating a list of carachters of a movie like "The Avengers"
* Thor
* Hulk
* Iron Man
* Captain America
* Hawk Eye
* Black Widow

### Creating a list of features
* Strength
* Speed
* Intelligence
* Super Powers
* Weakness
* Loyalty

### Playing the game
Randomly a carachter will be displayed, and user will have to place it in some of the features
Example:
* Hulk is selected, and user place it on Strength
